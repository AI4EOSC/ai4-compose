# Elyra-based solution

In this folder we will add nodes to interact with OSCAR for inference operations based in Elyra (https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

It is necessary to clone all the folders from the repository for the examples to work. Once the workflow is understood, you can create the folders and files required for your own examples or projects.
